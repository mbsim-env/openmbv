  /** A screen annotation defined by a Open Inventor file or a VRML file.
   *
   * This object is very special and behaves quite different compared to usual objects.
   * It not placed in the 3D scene and is not influenced by the camera or lights in the scene.
   * Hence, use e.g. a Material node with emissiveColor field to define the color of geometry.
   * It is placed in normalized screen coordinates. The x-axis is horizontal and the y-axis is vertical.
   * The bottom left coordinate is -1,-1 and the top right coordinate is 1,1.
   * The z-coordinate is irrelevant since z-buffering is disabled for these objects sicne its children are transparently render 
   * on top of the other. This means that a node defined later in the IV file will override previously nodes on the screen.
   * 
   * Note that the aspect ratio is only 1:1 if the screen is a square. However, it is possible to do an automatically scaling
   * to ensure that the aspect ratio is always 1:1, see setScale1To1At.
   *
   * The dynamic data of this object is defined by the user, see setColumnLabels. For each column a named node is created
   * which can be accessed from the IV file. The node name is the column label and the field "value" of this node holds the dynamic
   * data of the column.
   *
   * As e.g. RigidBody this object also provides drawing a path. The path point for each frame is defined by the origin of the node
   * named "OpenMBVIvScreenAnnotationPathOrigin" in the IV file. If no such node exists, no path is drawn.
   * If "OpenMBVIvScreenAnnotationPathOrigin" is given than also a node named "OpenMBVIvScreenAnnotationPathSep" of type Separator
   * must exist in the IV file. "OpenMBVIvScreenAnnotationPathSep" MUST NOT be influenced by any translation! However, its position
   * in the scene graph defines the order in with the path is drawn compared to the other nodes, see above.
   * The path is added as a child of this node.
   *
   * This object can also draw more than one path if the nodes are named "OpenMBVIvScreenAnnotationPathOrigin<nr>".
   * <nr> counts from 1 to N and stops if at the first node name which does not exist.
   * In this case the path is added as a child of the OpenMBVIvScreenAnnotationPathSep node, see above, or, if this node does not exist,
   * as a child of the OpenMBVIvScreenAnnotationPathSep<nr> node.
   *
   * All named nodes of name OpenMBVIvScreenAnnotation* are remove (during the ctor) from the
   * node/name mapping. */
